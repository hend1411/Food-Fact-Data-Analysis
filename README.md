# Food-Fact-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis and Visualization Description
Data Analysis:
Data Loading: We began by loading a CSV file containing food facts, focusing on nutritional information, particularly calories.
Error Handling: We addressed issues with mixed data types and missing columns. By checking the DataFrame's structure, we identified potential problems, such as the absence of a 'calories' column and ensured appropriate data types were set to facilitate analysis.
Exploration: The analysis involved exploring the DataFrame to identify relevant columns and understanding the dataset's structure. This was crucial for determining how to visualize the data effectively.
Data Visualization:
Visualizations Used:
Bar Chart: A bar chart was created to represent the distribution of calories across different ranges. This helped visualize how many products fell into each calorie range, allowing for quick insights into product categorization based on caloric content.
Pie Chart: A pie chart illustrated the proportions of different product categories. This visualization enabled an easy comparison of the relative sizes of each category, highlighting which categories dominate the dataset.
Communication of Results: The visualizations made it easier to communicate findings to stakeholders or peers. They provided a clear, visual summary of the data that could be quickly interpreted, rather than relying solely on numerical data.
Effectiveness of the Analysis
Information Retrieval: The analysis successfully provided insights into the distribution of calories and the composition of product categories. It allowed for a better understanding of dietary products available in the dataset.
Clarity and Insights: The visualizations helped clarify data trends and relationships that might not be immediately apparent through raw numbers, making the findings more accessible.
